<p>
  <div>What is this game about? It’s about navigating through the treacherous world that is the mind, 
    filled with riddles and puzzles that urge you to discover the mystery behind this realm. Heavily based off of Little Nightmares 2 and Pans Labyrinth.<p>

  </p>
<h2 id = "entities">Entities- Dement, Blackout, Sadness, Past, Neuroxus
</h2>

  <h2>DEMENT:</h2>
  <p>
Dement will invert controls, Blur screen out, and play a clock chiming sound every 5 seconds.
Makes you do a brain minigame (puzzle to fix brain, fix within 30 seconds you survive) and will kill you if you fail the brain minigame.
Dement will spawn randomly during  <a href = "#CT">The Cortex Castle</a> , which is the second setting where the game takes place. 
    Additionally, it can also appear in The Archive of the Unspoken, which serves as the third location in the game.
When your character meets their demise, a captivating visual unfolds: the clock’s hands spin to 3:00, and the clock itself begins to melt,
    reminiscent of the iconic <a href = "https://www.bing.com/search?go=Search&q=salvidor+dali+clock+painting&qs=ds&form=QBRE">Salvidor Dali Painting</a>

  </p>

  <h2>For the brain puzzle:</h2>
  <p>
It will be a 3x3 grid with a picture of a brain separated across the 9 pieces which you have to piece together to form a picture of the brain
The puzzle will have 2 different variations: front view and side view
Based off of the bing homepage puzzles

<h2>BLACKOUT:</h2>
<p> Will set the screen to pitch black, and if you move at ALL you will die. This will last about ten seconds.
When you die the screen will turn white leaving black streaks to start filling the screen up.
  Resembles the Over the Garden Wall scene with Wirt falling through the ice in episode 8.
When everything turns black, 
  a face resembling the <a href = "https://www.bing.com/search?q=no+players+online+entity&PC=U316&FORM=CHROMN">NO PLAYERS ONLINE</a> entity peeks out from the darkness.
Blackout will spawn randomly at the <a href = "#CD">Cerebellum docks
</a></p>
   <img src="Blackout Concept.jpeg" alt="Alt text" title="Optional title" width = "250" height = "150">
<h2>SADNESS:</h2>
<p>When Sadness is there the screen turns <a id = "blue">blue</a>
You find yourself in a four-way room. 
  Choose wisely: if you pick the right path, you’ll return to the castle; if you choose wrong, you’ll end up in another four-way room, repeating the process. 
  The entire sequence lasts about 30 seconds, and your speed is increased, so no need to worry about walking too slowly. 
  However, be aware that Sadness randomly appears in The Cortex Castle, and her crying echoes in the background.
  If you fail, Sadness grabs you, screams, and the screen goes black. It’s reminiscent of <a href = https://www.bing.com/search?q=scp-096&PC=U316&FORM=CHROMN>SCP-096</a>.

<h2>PAST:</h2>
<p>In the eerie halls of the <a href = "#archive"> Archive of the Unspoken</a>, two massive doors mark the entrance to where Past resides. 
  Once inside the dining room, Past remains dormant unless you dare to touch the food on the table. 
  A cutscene unfolds as you consume the meal, awakening Past. 
  Now, your escape begins—a frantic parkour chase, dodging falling objects from above. 
Past, when it claims you, a mirror reveals your skeletal reflection. 
  The pale man’s eyes from Pan’s Labyrinth adorn Past, but its unique features—mirror face and body—symbolize the haunting truth: what you flee is yourself.
</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN EQUILIBRIA:</h2>
<p>Captain Equilibria, an ethereal figure, dons a tattered captain’s coat that flows like underwater currents. 
  Their face remains veiled in mist, and their eyes emit a soft, unwavering glow—a symbol of balance and control. 
  As the guardian of the <a href = "#CD"> Cerebellum Docks </a>, the fourth game location, Captain Equilibria aids players in navigating physical coordination challenges.
  They steer ships through fog, each vessel representing distinct motor skills.
  Players learn to master fine control, overcoming obstacles in misty waters. 
  The ultimate test: synchronizing movements with the captain’s commands, mirroring the cerebellum’s role in motor precision.
  In a poignant cutscene, Captain meets their fate alongside their ship.(What if the twist is Captain Equilibria is the leading thought???)
</p>

<h2>NEUROXUS:</h2>
<p>Neuroxus, a shadowy and ever-shifting figure, embodies the fluidity of thoughts.
  Its tendrils of dark mist symbolize the grip of negativity on the mind. 
  At its core pulses a brain, signifying dominion over the mental realm. 
  Born from subconscious fears, Neuroxus thrives within the protagonist’s coma, feeding off their inability to awaken.
  The climactic showdown occurs at the <a href = "#SC">Summit of consciousness</a>, the final locale in the enigmatic world of Echoes. 
  Here, tranquility envelops the protagonist. Instead of a battle, a profound dialogue unfolds—a test of willpower.
  Just as victory Is assured, there's a blinding light, and a faint whisper from the Leading Thought saying: "Not yet. This is not the end, only the beginning."
  Then there is ending music and the game ends.

<h1 id = "settings">THE SETTINGS (in order):</h1>
<p><a><em>The Valley of Lost thoughts:</em></a> The valley would be filled with ethereal
  landscapes, where the terrain is made up of soft, rolling hills and deep 
  crevices. The color palette could be muted with occasional bursts of color 
  representing fleeting memories or important thoughts trying to resurface. 
  Scattered throughout the valley could be statues or monuments half-covered
  in fog, symbolizing incomplete or fragmented memories. Some paths might lead
  to dead ends or loop back on themselves, creating a sense of confusion and 
  disorientation. Ghostly figures might wander aimlessly, representing thoughts
  that have lost their purpose or meaning. Occasionally, a clearer figure might
  appear, guiding the player to a memory that needs to be reclaimed 
  (Leading Thought).</p>

<p><a id = "CT"><em>The Cortex Castle:</em></a> The Cortex Castle stands as a testament to the 
  mind’s capacity for complex thought and reasoning. Its towering spires
  and intricate parapets are carved from the very substance of cognitive
  processes, each stone representing a neuron in the vast network of the brain.</p>
 <img src="The Cortex Castle.jpeg" alt="Alt text" title="Optional title">
<p><a id = "archive"><em>Archive of the Unspoken:</em></a> A library filled with books that contain 
  words never said, thoughts never shared. This could be a place of puzzles
  where players piece together messages to unlock deeper parts of the mind. 
  Which is a part of <a href = "#CT">the cortex castle</a>.</p>

  <p><a id = "CD"><em>The Cerebellum Docks:</em></a>   The docks are a complex network of piers
  and platforms. The air is filled with the sounds of waves lapping 
  against the docks and the rhythmic creaking of the ships. The docks
  are constructed with a blend of sturdy wood and neural tissue, pulsating
  with the energy of muscle memory. Ships of various sizes, symbolizing
  different motor functions, are moored to the docks, swaying gently with 
  the cerebral currents. This is behind the cortex castle.</p>

<img src="Parabellum Docks.jpeg" alt="Alt text" title="Optional title">
<p><a id = "SC"><em>Summit of Consciousness:</em><a/> The summit is bathed in a soft, golden light, 
  symbolizing enlightenment and understanding. The landscape below is a 
  tapestry of the mind's experiences. Monoliths of pure thought dot the
  landscape, each representing a cornerstone of the individual’s identity.
  These structures are interconnected by bridges of light, signifying the 
  connections between different aspects of the self. Bathed in a radiant 
  light that cuts through the surrounding mists of uncertainty. The ground 
  is crystalline, reflecting thoughts and memories in vivid detail. When you 
  ride away from the cerebellum docks you arrive at the Summit of Consciousness.
  Thus is the end of the beginning.</p>
