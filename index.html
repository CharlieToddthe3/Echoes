Entities
Settings
Entities- Dement, Blackout, Sadness, Past, Neuroxus
DEMENT:
Inverts controls Blurs screen out, plays a clock chiming sound every 5 seconds Makes you do a brain minigame (puzzle to fix brain, fix within 30 seconds you survive) Kills you if you fail the brain minigame Dement will spawn randomly during The cortex castle the second setting the game takes place at and the archive of the unspoken which is the third location of the game When you die it shows the clock's hands spin to 3:00 and the clock melts resembling the Salvidor Dali Painting

For the brain puzzle:
It will be a 3x3 grid with a picture of a brain separated across the 9 pieces which you have to piece together to form a picture of the brain The puzzle will have 2 different variations: front view and side view Based off of the bing homepage puzzles

BLACKOUT:
Sets the screen to pitch black If you move at ALL you will die Lasts about ten seconds When you die the screen will turn white but black streaks start filling the screen up resembling the over the garden wall scene with Wirt falling through the ice When everything goes black a face starts peeking out of the darkness and then goes back. Resembling the NO PLAYERS ONLINE entity Blackout spawns randomly at the Cerebellum docks
<img src="/path/to/Blackout concept.jpeg" alt="Alt text" title="Optional title">

SADNESS:
When Sadness is there the screen turns blue You will be in a four way room and will have to go backwards to avoid sadness If you pick right: You will be back at the castle, If you pick wrong: You will be put into another four way room and have to repeat the process of picking the right room This whole sequence lasts about 30 seconds so choose wisely, your speed will be increased so don’t worry about walking so slow. This is mostly relying on luck Sadness randomly spawns in The cortex castle Sadness is sort of ghastly looking, stretched out and thin, based on a nightmare I had During this entire sequence there will be the sound of sadness crying If you die, Sadness grabs you and screams and the screen goes black (obviously not the final draft needs work) Resembles SCP-096.

PAST:
The way to know Past is in the hall ahead of you is because there are two huge doors at the end of the hall. Once you are in the dining room that Past is in, Past will appear inactive and will be unless you touch the food on the dining table If you do touch the food, there will be a cutscene showing you eating the food and past waking up. Then you’ll have to run and do parkour all the while avoiding things that are dropping from the ceiling (mostly books and bookcases). Past spawns inside the Archive of the Unspoken When you die to Past, Past picks you up and you look into a mirror and see a skeleton that is you (definitely needs work, NOT the final draft) It’s just a tad based on Pan's labyrinth Past has the pale man from Pan’s labyrinth eyes on hands, but the rest is unique: mirror face, mirror body, Signifying the thing you're running away from is you.

CAPTAIN EQUILIBRIA:
Captain Equilibria is an ethereal figure, clad in a tattered captain's coat that flows as if underwater. A misty veil obscures their face, and their eyes glow with a soft, steady light, symbolizing balance and control. As the guardian of the Cerebellum Docks , the fourth location of the game, Captain Equilibria helps players navigate the challenges of physical coordination and balance. They command the ships that sail through the fog, each vessel representing different motor skills an Players must work with Captain Equilibria to learn how to steer these ships through the misty waters, overcoming obstacles that represent various physical tasks. The captain provides guidance and insight into mastering the fine control needed to progress. The main challenge presented by Captain Equilibria involves a mini-game where players must synchronize their movements with the captain's commands to successfully navigate the ship. This represents the cerebellum's role in fine-tuning motor activities and maintaining equilibrium. In the end, Captain goes down with his ship in a cutscene. (What if the twist is Captain Equilibria is the leading thought???)

NEUROXUS:
Neuroxus could be a shadowy figure that shifts forms, representing the ever-changing nature of thoughts. It could have tendrils of dark mist that reach out, symbolizing the grip of negative thoughts on the mind. Its core could be a pulsating brain, indicating its control over the mental realm. Neuroxus was born from subconscious fears and has grown stronger with the character's coma. It seeks to keep the protagonist in a coma, feeding on the character's inability to wake up. We have a showdown with Neuroxus at the Summit of consciousness, the final location of Echoes of the mind. As the protagonist reaches the Summit of Consciousness, they find themselves in a place of absolute tranquility. The final confrontation with Neuroxus is intense, but instead of a battle, it's a dialogue that challenges the protagonist's will to return to reality. Just as the protagonist seems to have convinced Neuroxus to release them, a sudden shift occurs. The light fades, the summit trembles, and a deep voice echoes, "You're not ready yet." The screen cuts to black as a heartbeat monitor flatlines, leaving players questioning whether the protagonist has awakened or slipped further into the abyss. This ending leaves players on the edge of their seats, wondering about the true fate of the protagonist and setting up potential for a sequel or additional content.

THE SETTINGS (in order):
The Valley of Lost thoughts: The valley would be filled with ethereal landscapes, where the terrain is made up of soft, rolling hills and deep crevices. The color palette could be muted with occasional bursts of color representing fleeting memories or important thoughts trying to resurface. Scattered throughout the valley could be statues or monuments half-covered in fog, symbolizing incomplete or fragmented memories. Some paths might lead to dead ends or loop back on themselves, creating a sense of confusion and disorientation. Ghostly figures might wander aimlessly, representing thoughts that have lost their purpose or meaning. Occasionally, a clearer figure might appear, guiding the player to a memory that needs to be reclaimed (Leading Thought).

The Cortex Castle: The Cortex Castle stands as a testament to the mind’s capacity for complex thought and reasoning. Its towering spires and intricate parapets are carved from the very substance of cognitive processes, each stone representing a neuron in the vast network of the brain.

Archive of the Unspoken: A library filled with books that contain words never said, thoughts never shared. This could be a place of puzzles where players piece together messages to unlock deeper parts of the mind. Which is a part of the cortex castle.

The Cerebellum Docks: The docks are a complex network of piers and platforms. The air is filled with the sounds of waves lapping against the docks and the rhythmic creaking of the ships. The docks are constructed with a blend of sturdy wood and neural tissue, pulsating with the energy of muscle memory. Ships of various sizes, symbolizing different motor functions, are moored to the docks, swaying gently with the cerebral currents. This is behind the cortex castle.

Summit of Consciousness: The summit is bathed in a soft, golden light, symbolizing enlightenment and understanding. The landscape below is a tapestry of the mind's experiences. Monoliths of pure thought dot the landscape, each representing a cornerstone of the individual’s identity. These structures are interconnected by bridges of light, signifying the connections between different aspects of the self. Bathed in a radiant light that cuts through the surrounding mists of uncertainty. The ground is crystalline, reflecting thoughts and memories in vivid detail. When you ride away from the cerebellum docks you arrive at the Summit of Consciousness. Thus is the end of the beginning.
