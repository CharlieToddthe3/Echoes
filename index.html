Entities
Settings
Entities- Dement, Blackout, Sadness, Past, Neuroxus

DEMENT:
Inverts controls Blurs screen out, plays a clock chiming sound every 5 seconds Makes you do a brain minigame (puzzle to fix brain, fix within 30 seconds you survive) Kills you if you fail the brain minigame Dement will spawn randomly during The cortex castle the second setting the game takes place at and the archive of the unspoken which is the third location of the game When you die it shows the clock's hands spin to 3:00 and the clock melts resembling the Salvidor Dali Painting

For the brain puzzle:
It will be a 3x3 grid with a picture of a brain separated across the 9 pieces which you have to piece together to form a picture of the brain The puzzle will have 2 different variations: front view and side view Based off of the bing homepage puzzles


BLACKOUT:
Sets the screen to pitch black If you move at ALL you will die Lasts about ten seconds When you die the screen will turn white but black streaks start filling the screen up resembling the over the garden wall scene with Wirt falling through the ice When everything goes black a face starts peeking out of the darkness and then goes back. Resembling the NO PLAYERS ONLINE entity Blackout spawns randomly at the Cerebellum docks

SADNESS:
You will be put into a four way room.
If you pick right: You will be back at the castle, If you pick wrong: You will be put into another four way room and have to repeat the process of picking the right room
This whole sequence lasts about 30 seconds so choose wisely, your speed will be increased so don’t worry about walking so slow. Sadness randomly spawns in The Cortex Castle, and during this entire sequence the sound of Sadness crying plays in the background.
If you die, Sadness grabs you and screams and the screen goes black (obviously not the final draft needs work)

PAST:
In the eerie halls of the Archive of the Unspoken, two massive doors mark the entrance to where Past resides. Once inside the dining room, Past remains dormant unless you dare to touch the food on the table. A cutscene unfolds as you consume the meal, awakening Past. Now, your escape begins—a frantic parkour chase, dodging falling objects from above. Past, when it claims you, a mirror reveals your skeletal reflection. The pale man’s eyes from Pan’s Labyrinth adorn Past, but its unique features—mirror face and body—symbolize the haunting truth: what you flee is yourself. CAPTAIN EQUILIBRIA:
Captain Equilibria, an ethereal figure, dons a tattered captain’s coat that flows like underwater currents. Their face remains veiled in mist, and their eyes emit a soft, unwavering glow—a symbol of balance and control. As the guardian of the Cerebellum Docks, the fourth game location, Captain Equilibria aids players in navigating physical coordination challenges. They steer ships through fog, each vessel representing distinct motor skills. Players learn to master fine control, overcoming obstacles in misty waters. The ultimate test: synchronizing movements with the captain’s commands, mirroring the cerebellum’s role in motor precision. In a poignant cutscene, Captain meets their fate alongside their ship.
NEUROXUS:
Neuroxus, a shadowy and ever-shifting figure, embodies the fluidity of thoughts.
      Its tendrils of dark mist symbolize the grip of negativity on the mind. 
      At its core pulses a brain, signifying dominion over the mental realm.
      Born from subconscious fears, Neuroxus thrives within the protagonist’s coma, feeding off their inability to awaken. 
      The climactic showdown occurs at the Summit of Conciousness, the final locale in the enigmatic world of Echoes. 
  Here, tranquility envelops the protagonist. Instead of a battle, a profound dialogue unfolds—a test of willpower.
  Just as victory Is assured, there's a blinding light, and a faint whisper from the Leading Thought saying: "Not yet. This is not the end, only the beginning."
  Then there is ending music and the game ends.
THE SETTINGS (in order):
The Valley of Lost thoughts: The valley would be filled with ethereal landscapes, where the terrain is made up of soft, rolling hills and deep crevices. The color palette could be muted with occasional bursts of color representing fleeting memories or important thoughts trying to resurface. Scattered throughout the valley could be statues or monuments half-covered in fog, symbolizing incomplete or fragmented memories. Some paths might lead to dead ends or loop back on themselves, creating a sense of confusion and disorientation. Ghostly figures might wander aimlessly, representing thoughts that have lost their purpose or meaning. Occasionally, a clearer figure might appear, guiding the player to a memory that needs to be reclaimed (Leading Thought).
The Cortex Castle: The Cortex Castle stands as a testament to the mind’s capacity for complex thought and reasoning. Its towering spires and intricate parapets are carved from the very substance of cognitive processes, each stone representing a neuron in the vast network of the brain.

Archive of the Unspoken: A library filled with books that contain words never said, thoughts never shared. This could be a place of puzzles where players piece together messages to unlock deeper parts of the mind. Which is a part of the cortex castle.

The Cerebellum Docks: The docks are a complex network of piers and platforms. The air is filled with the sounds of waves lapping against the docks and the rhythmic creaking of the ships. The docks are constructed with a blend of sturdy wood and neural tissue, pulsating with the energy of muscle memory. Ships of various sizes, symbolizing different motor functions, are moored to the docks, swaying gently with the cerebral currents. This is behind the cortex castle.

Summit of Consciousness: The summit is bathed in a soft, golden light, symbolizing enlightenment and understanding. The landscape below is a tapestry of the mind's experiences. Monoliths of pure thought dot the landscape, each representing a cornerstone of the individual’s identity. These structures are interconnected by bridges of light, signifying the connections between different aspects of the self. Bathed in a radiant light that cuts through the surrounding mists of uncertainty. The ground is crystalline, reflecting thoughts and memories in vivid detail. When you ride away from the cerebellum docks you arrive at the Summit of Consciousness. Thus is the end of the beginning.
